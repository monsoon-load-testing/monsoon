    - `monsoon init` DONE
        - make a directory `monsoon`

          - `npm install`
        - a default test_config.json (concurrentUsers, testDuration) - a single source of truth for parameters
        - cdk: include aws infrastructure inside the CLI -> deploy directly DONE
        - current solution for aws credentals: create global .monsoon -> store credentials in .env file DONE

    - wrap around `cdk synth`, `cdk bootstrap`, `cdk deploy`.  DONE
    Our package needs to include the source codes (aws folder)

- monsoon start mytest: A command to start the test DONE
(rename the test script according to our infrastructure and upload to S3)
    - will not be allowed until the user builds the infrastructure (strech goal)
    - monsoon start (sdk-level): we are going to need their credentials
      - scan the S3 buckets and find(regex) the monsoon S3
      - change the testscript name to test_script.js upload test_script to S3
      - after the upload -> scan the lambdas and find the startingLambda
      - start the lambda
- monsoon update: update the parameters if they want to change it (optional - strech goal)
- monsoon teardown: A command to tear-down infrastructure (except timestream) DONE
    - will be the same logic as deploy
- monsoon weather-channel-on: A command to spin up the dashboard
